			<h1>HiðŸ‘‹I'm Warren. By education I specialize in mathematical modelling & simulation, and up until a few weeks ago I was an electrical designer/analyst in the electric utility industry. Now I'm working on expanding my skill set to be a #FullStack engineer.

			<h1>Welcome</h1>
			<p>Fast forwarding through much of the early associates in engineering bits, I essentially started out as a math person. I loved it (and still very much do), I loved it so much that, it is all I wanted to do. Working with my professors, doing research, a bunch of fancy upper division electives (partial differential equations, nonlinear physics, mathematical modelling, etc.), all for the hopes of going on to do my PhD in mathematical modelling.</p>

<p>As a STEM major I then realized that there was a massive gap in my knowledge, a gap that if left unfilled would prove itself to be deeply hindering, especially given the current age in which we live.  I had the S, E, and the M, the missing skill was the T, i.e. proficiency in a coding language. All my years of academia and not once was I told of the amazing utility of having coding ability.</p>

<p>Realizing my gross lack in computer science knowledge, I then set out to teach myself Python, and in a relatively short space of time gained enough knowledge (Stackoverflow was a huge resource) to tackle my first data science project, with the help of Kaggle. I did some pretty cool projects; like working on a NBA player dataset and looking at the relationship between their height, weight, and what position they play. I also did a deep learning project using LSTM (long short term memory) to train a model to â€˜rapâ€™. I then set out to learn more. </p>
